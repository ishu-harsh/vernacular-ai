### 2. Auditing Hardware
We work with companies that require our solution to be deployed on premise. For that we receive hardware, and auditing that hardware becomes important part of our deployment process.

Write a bash script to audit the following hardware spec in [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux). The script should print out following specifications:
- OS version
- Kernel version
- CPU - Virtual cores (ratio to physical cores if possible)
- CPU - Clock speed
- CPU - Architecture
- RAM
- Networking - Bandwidth
- Networking - OS Firewall (Allowed Ports & Protocols)
- Networking - Network Firewall (Allowed Ports & Protocols)
- Disk - Mounted/Unmounted volumes, type, storage
